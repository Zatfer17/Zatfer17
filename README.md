### 🕹️ My projects
- [My website](https://www.matteoferrini.xyz/): realized with [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) and [Fruition](https://fruitionsite.com/). I try to keep my digital identity as minimal as possible, so using Notion, which I already use daily, seemed like the perfect choice to me;
- [Data Driven Storytelling](https://team-footplus.medium.com/who-will-be-caught-in-the-net-an-unsung-story-on-the-ecological-impact-of-fishing-and-aquaculture-96e2d640d3b3): together with [Mattia](https://github.com/mattiasu96), [Carlo](https://github.com/carlovitellio) and [Virginia](https://github.com/VirginiaMigliorini), I wrote a report on sustainable fishing leveraging open data;
- [Potter Time](https://zatfer17.github.io/): a 25h clock, basically [I hacked time](https://youtu.be/Qp61ysbPG-8?t=157);
- [Museec](https://museec2.bubbleapps.io/version-test/index/Lorem%20ipsum...?debug_mode=true): an AI generated museum exhibition at your fingertips, hit me up if you want an invite to try it;
- [Doink!](https://github.com/Zatfer17/Doink-the-game): an 80s inspired Android 2D game written in LUA. Can be downloaded from the Play Store at this [link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.qwerteam.Doink&hl=en_US&gl=US). Fun fact: the name comes from a popular [move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWVBrlGZMYM) in Rocket League.
